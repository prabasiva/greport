    # RUSTSEC-2023-0071: Marvin Attack in rsa crate
    # This is a transitive dependency from sqlx-mysql.
    # No fix is currently available. Tracking:
    # - https://github.com/RustCrypto/RSA/issues/19
    # - https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0071
    # Risk: Medium (5.9) - timing sidechannel for potential key recovery
    # Mitigation: We don't directly use RSA encryption; this is only used
    # for MySQL authentication which is typically over localhost/TLS.
